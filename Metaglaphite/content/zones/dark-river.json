 { name: "Dark river"
   description: "This place was once an oasis full of life, until one day river painted black. Giant oil outpour killed everything here thousands of years ago. Centuries of drying and water is no more. Enemies will try to conquer this sector, make metaglaphite and stop the invasion once and for all."
